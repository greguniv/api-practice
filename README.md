# Making a News App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Task

Your software engineering team has been hired by angel investors Teo, Manara, and Devin.

Unfortunately, these angel investors are so rich and indecisive that they don't know what they want! They just want to invest!

They don't know much about tech, but they heard about APIs (A Piece of Information) or whatever they think it means.

They said it sounded cool, and they want you to use it to create a website.
